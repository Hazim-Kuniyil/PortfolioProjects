Acres of grass, city scape is breath taking. I literally will just walk around and tour the open world just to enjoy the life like visuals of this game.\n",

      "Cons:\n",

      "Game play is repetive and can become dull. Shoot, shoot, fly, fly, chute, chute, boom, boom. You get the picture. Nothing interesting here to a seasoned gamer.\n",
      "Story is not that interesting. I don't really care much about the characters involved in the story. There is really no emotional grasp for the player to actually latch on to anything.\n",
      "Nothing to look forward to. The whole idea behind getting a game is to look forward to doing something worth wild in the future missions or story. Seems you just continue doing the same s*** over and over again with different weapons, upgrades, vehicles.\n",
      "Vehicles like motorbikes are a pain to drive. They feel way too sensitive to turning and hitting a small rock has your character flying into a field.\n",
      "Guns are annoyingly the same. They don't feel different when upgrading.\n",
